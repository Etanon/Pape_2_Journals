At Rackspace, the most important skills noted for achieving employment were problem-solving and active code development.
For example, presenters noted that they would be most likely to hire someone who goes home and spends hours working with Linux and networking.
Does that describe you? Why or why not?
I like to solve problems but maybe I'm not as passionate about Linux as they however stuff I like I do spend a lot of time thinking about and like to work until I solve the problem


Similarly, presenters noted a demand for employees who were good at independent problem solving. Does that describe you? Why or why not?
Yes, because even though I like working in a group and contributing working alone is fine.

Have you finished your disk image? Why or why not? 
No, because I was behind on the challenge due to the virtualbox disaster of 2015 for me but I have just finished that challenge and have already made it halfway through the disk image.
