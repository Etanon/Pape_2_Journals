Well today I went to virtualbox and tried to do the assignment when I realized that I did not have access to the usr/share/digitalforensics so I phoned a friend and Julian came to my side and was like here you go champ and I said thanks cause now I have a working virtualbox and I started the assignment and got about halfway into it (and was able to sumbit it the next day). Happy times.
