File - helps you analyze files, find information about them
Find - helps you serach through data in a directory
Grep - finds lines in a file that match the pattern you gave it
| -  allows different commands to be used
>> -  outputs what the command did to a specific file.
Give a specific example of how you might combine the commands for digital forensics?
you could find a file or folder, then pipe to grep for a specific thing you are looking for (like a pattern) and then output using the >> to a specific file
