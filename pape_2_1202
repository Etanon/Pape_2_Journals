what processes are you learning that lead to file recovery?
I am learning that if I want to recover a file that has been deleted on a disk you can use the file header of the file type to look
the hexdump mess of zeros and be able to find and recover that which was deleted

And may be extensible to other aspects of problem solving and life?
I guess you could say that it doesn't matter what the information is what matters is how good you are at actually solving the problem and applying fundamental techniques
